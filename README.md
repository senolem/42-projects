# senolem's 42 projects

Main repo for all my 42 projects. Started in February 2022.

Please be aware that I'm a student thus take nothing in my code for granted, there might be stupid things, leaks and stuff. I'm kinda lazy but I might fix my older projects someday!

## FAQ

#### Can I use it for my projects?

Sure! But do it at your own risk.

#### What are your grades?

I'm not giving grades for my projects to encourage you testing things before even pushing your project.
If a project has been modified recently it is likely that I'm still working on it, otherwise you can consider I succeeded the defense, that's all.
